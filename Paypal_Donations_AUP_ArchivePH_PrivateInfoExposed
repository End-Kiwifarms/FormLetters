I would like to make a complaint about a Paypal customer using the Donation button to host an 'archive' site on behalf of Kiwifarms. There is no way to remove personal information from the archive, and the site enables to identity theft, swatting, and other real life harassment. Kiwifarms uses archive.ph to post the personal information of their targets, and they will also stalk and harass the family and friends of their targets.

The site is located at archive.ph - The donation button ID is: JK2ECW9A9SMMS

The site using the Paypal Donation Link breaks your terms of service in this way:

You may not use PayPal Donations for the explicit or implicit purpose of or involving: post private, confidential, or proprietary data or information about a third party, without the express consent of that third party

Joshua Moon of 1776 Hosting LLC has been de-platformed from many Payment Providers, including paypal. Archive.ph provides a hosting service for kiwifarms identity theft. 

I've attached some news articles about recent kiwifarms activity:

Iâ€™d like to add my voice to request that you immediately suspend their Paypal donation service based on those violations. Paypal should not be enabling identity theft or online harassment. 

Thank you for your time and prompt consideration of this matter.
